Description: Analyze spatial phylogenetic diversity patterns. 
    Use your data on an evolutionary tree and geographic distributions of the 
    terminal taxa to compute diversity and endemism metrics, test significance 
    with null model randomization, analyze community turnover and biotic 
    regionalization, and perform spatial conservation prioritizations. All 
    functions support quantitative community data in addition to binary data.
