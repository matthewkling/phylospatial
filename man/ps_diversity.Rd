\title{Calculate spatial phylogenetic diversity and endemism metrics}
\usage{
ps_diversity(ps, metric = "all", spatial = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{ps}{phylospatial object (created by \code{phylospatial()} or \code{ps_simulate()}).}

\item{metric}{Character vector containing the abbreviation for one or more diversity metrics listed in
the details below. Can also specify \code{"all"} (the default) to calculate all available metrics.}

\item{spatial}{Logical: should the function return a spatial object (TRUE, default) or a matrix (FALSE)?}
}
\value{
A matrix, \code{sf} data frame, or \code{SpatRaster} with a column or layer for each requested diversity metric.
}
\description{
This function calculates a variety of alpha phylogenetic diversity metrics, including measures of richness,
regularity, and divergence. If continuous community data (probabilities or abundances) are provided,
they are used in calculations, giving quantitative versions of the classic binary metrics.
}
\details{
The function calculates the following metrics. Endemism-weighted versions of most metrics are
available. All metrics are weighted by occurrence probability or abundance, if applicable.

\strong{Richness measures:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{TD}---Terminal Diversity, i.e. richness of terminal taxa (in many cases these are species): \eqn{\sum_{t}{p_t}}
\item \strong{TE}---Terminal Endemism, i.e. total endemism-weighted diversity of terminal taxa, a.k.a. "weighted endemism": \eqn{\sum_{t}{p_t r_t^{-1}}}
\item \strong{CD}---Clade Diversity, i.e. richness of taxa at all levels (equivalent to PD on a cladogram): \eqn{\sum_{b}{p_b}}
\item \strong{CE}---Clade Endemism, i.e. total endemism-weighted diversity of taxa at all levels (equivalent to PE on a cladrogram): \eqn{\sum_{b}{p_b r_b^{-1}}}
\item \strong{PD}---Phylogenetic Diversity, i.e. total branch length occurring in a site: \eqn{\sum_{b}{L_b p_b}}
\item \strong{PE}---Phylogenetic Endemism, i.e. endemism-weighted PD: \eqn{\sum_{b}{L_b p_b r_b^{-1}}}
\item \strong{ShPD}---Shannon Phylogenetic Diversity, a.k.a. "phylogenetic entropy" (this version is the log of the "effective diversity" version based on Hill numbers):
\eqn{-\sum_{b}{L_b n_b log(n_b)}}
\item \strong{ShPE}---Shannon phylogenetic Endemism, an endemism-weighted version of ShPD: \eqn{-\sum_{b}{L_b n_b log(e_b) r_b^{-1}}}
\item \strong{SiPD}---Simpson Phylogenetic Diversity: \eqn{1 / \sum_{b}{L_b n_b^2}}
\item \strong{SiPE}---Simpson Phylogenetic Endemism, an endemism-weighted version of SiPD: \eqn{1 / \sum_{b}{L_b r_b^{-1} e_b^2}}
}

\strong{Divergence measures:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{RPD}---Relative Phylogenetic Diversity, i.e. mean branch segment length (equivalent to PD / CR): \eqn{\sum_{b}{L_b p_b} / \sum_{b}{p_b}}
\item \strong{RPE}---Relative Phylogenetic Endemism, i.e. mean endemism-weighted branch segment length (equivalent to PE / CE): \eqn{\sum_{b}{L_b p_b r_b^{-1}} / \sum_{b}{p_b r_b^{-1}}}
\item \strong{MPDT}---Mean Pairwise Distance between Terminals, i.e. the classic MPD metric. This is the average of cophenetic distances, weighted by \eqn{p_t}.
\item \strong{MPDN}---Mean Pairwise Distance between Nodes, an experimental version of MPD that considers distances between every pair of non-nested clades, putting more weight on deeper branches than does MPDT.
This is the mean of distances between all collateral (non-lineal) node pairs including terminal and internal nodes, weighted by \eqn{p_b}.
\item Note that divergence can also be assessed by using \code{ps_rand()} to run null model analyses of richness measures like PD.
}

\strong{Regularity measures}:
\itemize{
\item \strong{VPDT}---Variance in Pairwise Distances between Terminals, i.e. the classic VPD metric, weighted by \eqn{p_t}.
\item \strong{VPDN}---Variance in Pairwise Distances between Nodes, i.e. MPDN but variance.
}

In the above equations, \eqn{b} indexes all taxa including terminals and larger clades; \eqn{t} indexes terminals only; \eqn{p_i} is the occurrence value
(binary, probability, or abundance) of clade/terminal \eqn{i} in a given community; \eqn{L_b} is the
length of the phylogenetic branch segment unique to clade \eqn{b}; and \eqn{r_i} is the sum of \eqn{p_i} across all sites. For Shannon
and Simpson indices, only nonzero elements of \eqn{p_b} are used, \eqn{n_b = p_b / \sum_{b}{p_b L_b}}, and \eqn{e_b = p_b / \sum_{b}{p_b L_b r_b^{-1}}}.
