\title{Compute a phyologenetic turnover matrix}
\usage{
ps_dist(sp, endemism = FALSE, normalize = TRUE, add = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{sp}{spatialphy object.}

\item{endemism}{Logical indicating whether occurrence values should be divided by column (species) totals.}

\item{normalize}{Logical indicating whether occurrence values should be divided by row (community) totals.
If so, this happens after endemism division.}

\item{add}{Logical indicating whether results should be added to the spatialphy object and returned (TRUE) or returned alone (FALSE)?}
}
\value{
A pairwise phylogenetic difference matrix, with values of 1/PhyloSor, either on its own or as an element of \code{sp}.
}
