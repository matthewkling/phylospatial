ps_dissim(

)

\arguments{
\item{ps}{phylospatial object.}

\item{method}{Character indicating the dissimilarity index to use:
\itemize{
\item{"sorensen": }{Sorensen's dissimilarity, a.k.a. Bray-Curtis distance (the default)}
\item{"sorensen_turnover": }{The turnover component of Sorensen's dissimilarity, a.k.a. Simpson's.}
\item{"sorensen_nestedness": }{The nestedness component of Sorensen's dissimilarity.}
\item{Any other valid \code{method} passed to \code{fun}. }{For options, see the documentation for those functions.}
}}

\item{fun}{Character indicating which general distance function from the \code{vegan} library to use: "\link[vegan]{vegdist}"
(the default), "\link[vegan]{designdist}", or "\link[vegan]{chaodist}". (While these functions are not explicitly
designed to calculate phylogenetic beta diversity, their use here incorporates the phylogenetic components.)
This argument is ignored if one of the three "sorensen" methods is selected.}

\item{endemism}{Logical indicating whether community values should be divided by column totals (taxon range sizes)
to derive endemism before computing distances.}

\item{normalize}{Logical indicating whether community values should be divided by row totals (community sums) before
computing distances. If \code{TRUE}, dissimilarity is based on proportional community composition. Normalization is
applied after endemism.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{fun}.}
}
\value{
A pairwise phylogenetic dissimilarity matrix of class \code{dist}.
}
\description{
This function calculates pairwise phylogenetic dissimilarity between communities. It works with both binary and
quantitative community data sets. A wide range of phylogentic community dissimilarity metrics are supported,
including phylogenetic Sorensen's and Jaccard's distances, turnover and nestedness components of Sorensen's distance
(Baselga & Orme, 2012), and phylogenetic versions of all community distance indices provided through the \code{vegan} library.
The function also includes options to scale the community matrix in order to focus the analysis on endemism and/or
on proportional differences in community composition. The results from this function can be visualized using
\link{ps_rgb} or \link{ps_regions}, or used in a variety of statistical analyses.

\examples{
# The default arguments give Sorensen's quantitative dissimilarity index
# (a.k.a. Bray-Curtis distance):
d <- ps_dissim(moss)

# This is equivalent to specifying to the formula explicitly via `designdist`:
d <- ps_dissim(moss, method = "(b+c)/(2*a+b+c)", fun = "designdist", terms = "minimum", abcd = TRUE)

# Alternative arguments can specify a wide range of dissimilarity measures;
# here's endemism-weighted Jaccard's dissimilarity:
d <- ps_dissim(moss, method = "jaccard", endemism = TRUE)
