\title{Stratified randomization of community matrix}
\usage{
quantize(
  x,
  n_strata = 5,
  transform = identity,
  algorithm = "curveball",
  jitter = 0.99,
  priority = "neither",
  n_iter = 10000,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Community matrix with species in rows, sites in columns, and nonnegative quantities in cells.}

\item{n_strata}{Integer giving the number of strata to split the data into. Must be 2 or greater. Larger values
will result in randomizations with less mixing but higher fidelity to marginal distributions.}

\item{transform}{A function used to transform the values in \code{x} before assigning them to \code{n_strata}
equal intervals. Examples include \code{sqrt}, \code{log}, \code{rank}, etc.; the default is \code{identity}.}

\item{algorithm}{Null model algorithm, passed to \code{vegan::nullmodel}. Testing has only been done with the
"curveball" algorithm, so other options should be use with caution. Only binary methods should be used.}

\item{jitter}{Number between 0 and 1, indicating how much to randomly jitter the location of stratum boundaries.}

\item{priority}{Either "rows", "cols", or "neither", indicating whether randomization within strata should
prioritize maintaining the marginal distributions of the rows or columns of the input matrix. The default,
"neither", doesn't give precedence to either dimension.}

\item{n_iter}{Positive integer giving the number of iterations to use for stepwise algorithms.}

\item{...}{Ignored.}
}
\value{
A randomized version of \code{x}.
}
\description{
This is a community null model method for quantitative community data (e.g. abundance or occurrence probability)
that preserves row and column totals, and also approximately preserves the marginal distributions of
rows and columns. For each randomization, the data set is split into strata representing numerical ranges
of the input quantities, a separate binary randomization is done for each stratum, and the results are
combined to produce a randomized, quantitative community matrix. See \code{vegan::commsim()} for details about
other binary and quantitative null models.
