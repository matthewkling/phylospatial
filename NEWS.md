# phylospatial 1.1.0

# Changes in version 1.1.0

* `ps_diversity()` now includes several new divergence and regularity measures, including terminal- and node-based versions of mean pairwise distance (MPD) and variance in pairwise distance (VPD).

* `ps_rand()` now includes an explicit `"tip_shuffle"` algorithm; previously this method could only be implemented by supplying a custom randomization function.

# phylospatial 1.0.0

* Initial release
