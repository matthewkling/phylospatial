# phylospatial: Spatial Phylogenetic Analysis

Analyze spatial phylogenetic diversity patterns. Use your data on an
evolutionary tree and geographic distributions of the terminal taxa to
compute diversity and endemism metrics, test significance with null
model randomization, analyze community turnover and biotic
regionalization, and perform spatial conservation prioritizations. All
functions support quantitative community data in addition to binary
data.
